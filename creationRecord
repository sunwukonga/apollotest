Install nvm with:
`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash`
then close session and re-open new one (sets environment variables properly).

Install latest node
`nvm install node`

Install yarn with:
  install repo
```
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
```
  update apt
`sudo apt update`
  install yarn
`sudo apt install --no-install-recommends yarn`
the --no-install-recommends is so nodejs is not reinstalled

Make directory for repo:
```
cd ~/code
mkdir itsy-server
```

Initiate node package
```
yarn init
```
itsy-server; itsybit backend server; server.js; private true

[Note] No means of pinning a rootCA for the Expo app. This means we cannot use a self-signed certificate.
When we go to production we will need a proper domain and paid SSL certificate. In the meantime, use no
cert in development. If we're really lucky, by the time we app is ready for production, we'll be able
to use a self signed certificate: https://datacenteroverlords.com/2012/03/01/creating-your-own-ssl-certificate-authority/
Which would mean that this issue (https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/ssl-pinning) was implemented.
